# Libraries

Plex servers are organized with Libraries in order to help organize and sort content. Libraries are broad categories like TV shows and movies, and depending on what device or platform you're using Plex from, the interface can vary slightly. Typically, you will find a list of the Libraries on the server located in a table on the left side of the display. Clicking or tapping the name of a Library will change the content view on the bulk of the page to that Library.

Libraries are often further separated into subjects like 4K, Reality TV, Kid's TV or Documentaries to facilitate finding what you want to watch.

***Note:** The Plex creators recently added new Libraries that appears for all users called Movies & TV On Plex, Web Shows, Podcasts and Music. Users should know that the ad-supported content in this special library is not provided by the owner of the Plex server and is available through a deal between Plex software and a number of movie and/or music studios. Plex server owners have no control over the content of this library. In most Plex players, you can find an option to Unpin this library from your list so it doesn't appear.*

With Plex and Blackbeard Media, you have control over what you watch and how you watch it. One of the main ways you can customize your viewing experience on Plex is by curating your own playlists and using filters and sorting options. You can easily access these features within each library, where you have the option to switch between Recommended, Library, Collections, or Playlists.

!!! info "Recommended"

    This view shows a mix of items that are new or popular in the library selected by the server.

!!! info "Library"

    This view shows the full contents of the library in alphabetical order by default, but you can use filters and sorting to change how the list is presented. With personalized recommendations based on viewing history, you can find new content that fits your interests and preferences. Plex offers a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and find the content you want.

!!! info "Collections"

    If the server owner has curated collections of content, they will appear here. These may include grouped genres of movies, different TV networks for series, or film franchises.
    
    This is just a test to see if it will keep the box

!!! info "Playlists"

    If the server owner has curated playlists of content, such as all the films in a series, they may be presented here. It is normal if this page is empty.

One of the advantages of using Plex and Blackbeard Media is that it is available on a variety of devices and platforms, making it accessible to a wide audience. With our user-friendly navigation and extensive libraries of movies and TV shows, with audiobooks and music coming soon, you can easily find new content to explore based on your interests and preferences.
