# What is Plex?

## So what is Plex anyway?
You can think of Plex as a streaming service like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video that is operated by someone you know instead of a huge company. What this means is that they have complete control over what content is available, and can often obtain shows and movies that you're looking for.

## Is Plex free?
Server owners typically provide access to close friends and family only and don't charge for it.

Many server operators do pay a monthly or yearly fee for some additional features known as Plex Pass from the company that makes the Plex software. This helps to support ongoing efforts to make the Plex software better.

Additionally, Plex servers are a significant investment for the owner. The server hardware and storage devices are expensive to obtain and operate.

As a viewer, you can connect to and watch content on Plex servers for free through the  web site. However viewing on the [https://plex.tv](https://plex.tv/) website often requires that the server transcode the media for you (more on that later). By using a Plex player that's specific to your hardware and platform, you'll get a better playback experience. On some platforms like iPhone and iPad as well as Android phones and tablets, you will have to pay a small one-time fee (around $5 USD) to activate the Plex player on your iTunes or Google Play account. This will unlock the player on all the devices you use on your account.

## Is Plex legal?
Plex is just a collection of software encompassing servers and clients. Plex itself is perfectly legal.

You can use Plex to stream content anywhere without worrying about copyright notices or the need to use a VPN or other means to hide your traffic.

Depending on where the server is located and how the available media on the server was obtained, there is a large grey area of legality surrounding copyright issues.
