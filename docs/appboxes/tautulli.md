# Tautulli

Tautulli is a powerful tool that can be used to monitor and track activity on a Plex Media Server. It can be used to track things like who is watching what, when they are watching it, and how they are watching it. Tautulli can also be used to generate notifications, such as when someone starts watching a new movie or TV show.

To use Tautulli, you first need to install it via the Kronos dashboard. Once it is installed, you can configure it and start using it to monitor your Plex Media Server.

Below, you will provide an overview of Tautulli and its features, benefits, and how to use it. It will also include links to further documentation and support resources.

### Monitor usage

Tautulli can help you monitor how much of your appbox's resources are being used by your users. You can use this information to determine if you need to upgrade your appbox or if you need to limit the number of users who can access your server at the same time. You can also track who is transcoding and how many users are actively transcoding and watching at the same time. This will help you determine if it is needed to upgrade plans. Please note that audio transcoding is not counted and users should mostly be concerned about video transcoding.

### Track Activity

Tautulli can help you track what your users are watching and when they are watching it. This information can be used to determine what content is popular and what content is not. For example, you can create a collection of the most popular movies on your appbox, or you can create a collection of movies that you think your users would enjoy, based on their past viewing habits.

### Generate Notifications

Tautulli can generate notifications when certain events occur, such as when a new user starts watching a movie or TV show. These notifications can be used to provide a better experience for your users by letting them know when new content is available or when they have new messages from other users.

### Provide Access to Watch History

Tautulli can provide your users with access to their watch history, which can be used to help them find the content they are looking for or to help them keep track of what they have watched. This information can also be helpful for users who want to track their viewing habits over time or who want to identify any trends in their viewing. In addition, Tautulli can help users troubleshoot problems by showing if they are direct playing or transcoding content as well as the required bandwidth of the file they are watching.

### Generate Reports

Tautulli can also be used to generate reports that can be used to track progress over time, identify trends, and make informed decisions about how to improve to improve the appbox. For example, you can use a report to see how many users you have added in the past month, or to see which shows and movies are most popular. You can also see how much bandwidth your viewers are using, or to see if any of your users are constantly transcoding by viewing their play history.
