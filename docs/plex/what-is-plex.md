# What is Plex?

Plex is a streaming service that allows you to watch movies, TV shows, and other media on your computer, smartphone, tablet, or smart TV. It's like having your own personal Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, but with content curated by someone you know and trust instead of a faceless corporation.

## Is Plex free?
Plex is free to use as a software. However, on some mobile operating systems such as Android or iOS, a small one-time fee (around $5 USD) may be required to activate the Plex player on your iTunes or Google Play account. This will unlock the player on all the devices you use on your account.

Our streaming services that utilizes Plex do have costs. We offer Plex share plans ranging from $1.99 per month to $7.99 per month. Additionally, we offer appboxes which range from $14.99 to $29.99 per month. Appboxes allow users to invite their friends and family to join the server at no additional cost.

## Is Plex legal?
Plex is just a collection of software encompassing servers and clients. Plex itself is perfectly legal and you can use Plex to stream content anywhere without worrying about copyright notices or the need to use a VPN or other means to hide your traffic.

Depending on where the server is located and how the available media on the server was obtained, there is a large grey area of legality surrounding copyright issues.
