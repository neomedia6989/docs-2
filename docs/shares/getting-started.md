To sign up for our share service, you'll need a Plex account. If you don't have one already, you can get more info [here](../plex/getting-started.md).

Once you have a Plex account, you can sign up for our share service by going to https://blackbeard.media/register and entering the referral code provided by your friend or family member. After registering, you'll need to validate your email by clicking the link in the email that we send you.

Once you're validated, you can log in to https://blackbeard.media and access our home page, where you can learn more about our service and subscribe to any of our plans. We offer both pay-as-you-go and recurring subscriptions. If you have a promo code, make sure to select pay-as-you-go to use it. To sign up for your free trial or to subscribe, click the relevant link on the top of the navigation bar when you are signed in.

You can also find your referral code on the same account page, which you can share with your friends and family. For each person who signs up for a paid subscription using your referral code, you'll receive a credit that matches their first payment. This same page is also where you can manage your subscription, view your payment history, and update your personal information. If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team on Discord or through our contact page.
