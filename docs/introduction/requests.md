# Requests

Requests are one of the most straightforward features, that does exactly what the name suggests: You ask for some content from the person running your share, they download it, and it appears in their Plex library to watch. This is often considered one of the most important features in a Plex share. Having 10,000 movies on hand is a great thing, but do they have that one movie that you are looking for? Here, is how to evaluate requests:

## Source

Where is the content, and requests, being sourced from? Are they getting movies/shows from public trackers, crappy indexers, etc. or are you getting them from rare, private trackers and exclusive indexers? This will often show in request fulfillment and completion rate. If you just want to watch the latest episode of a show, or a recently released blockbuster movie, then this is not of as much concern to you as our next point, since popular content shows up everywhere anyway.

## Speed

How soon are the requests filled? Oftentimes, requests will be given download priority over other content, that is being downloaded and fed into the server. Speed ends up mattering the most when you want to watch the new episode of any given show as soon as it comes out, rather than weeks later.

## Automated vs Manual

The third and final consideration in requests is the method of requesting them, and how they're handled. One example way to handle requests is an application such as Ombi, Overseerr, or Petio. These apps are programs that a server owner can setup, and users can access a slick UI from which to search movies/TV shows and request them. They are then linked to the server share's backend automation, so it can obtain what you requested automatically. As a user, you don't need to install anything, and usually you will login to them with your Plex credentials. 

Another method that some Plex servers utilize is Discord servers and request bots, wherein you request content in a specific channel, which is then automatically added. 

And finally, others offer a more manual solution, where you mention the title in a channel, and the owner looks for it and downloads it. Most users tend to disagree with this form of requests more than the rest. Manual requests have the disadvantage of requiring the owner's attention and time, but manual requests are often the most robust since they don't fail in any scenarios unlike automation, such as movies/TV not catalogued correctly by IMDB/TMDB, rare shows/cinema, mislabeled content, and/or anime *(Nearly all of which requires manual intervention to correct, so it shows up properly in Plex)*.
