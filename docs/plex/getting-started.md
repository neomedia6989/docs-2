??? tip "Recommended Settings"

    === "Security > 2FA"

        Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Plex account adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code generated by a separate device in addition to your password when logging in. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account, even if someone manages to obtain your password.

        Once you have set up two-factor authentication, you will need to enter a code from your authenticator app in addition to your password when logging in to your Plex account. This adds an extra layer of security to your account and helps protect your personal information.
