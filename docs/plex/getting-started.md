    === "Two-Factor Authentication"

        Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Plex account adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code generated by a separate device in addition to your password when logging in. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account, even if someone manages to obtain your password.
        
        1. Click "Edit" on the account settings page.
        2. Enter your password.
        3. Scan the QR code displayed on your screen using an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator.
        4. Save your recovery code in a secure location.
        
        Once you have set up two-factor authentication, you will need to enter a code from your authenticator app in addition to your password when logging in to your Plex account. This adds an extra layer of security to your account and helps protect your personal information.
        
    === "Sync Watch State & Ratings"

        Enabling Sync Watch History in Plex is a great way to keep track of what you've watched and get personalized recommendations for new content. By syncing your watched/played state and personal ratings with your Plex account, you can seamlessly transition between devices and servers while maintaining a consistent viewing experience. This feature also enhances your overall Plex experience by providing accurate data for Plex's Discover feature and any Plex Media Server you have access to.
        
        1. Click on the "Sync My Watch State and Ratings" box in the settings.
        2. Enable the feature.
        3. Plex will now sync the data of watched state and user ratings, which includes the Plex account user ID, the GUID for the title, the date and time the action was taken, and the state or rating submitted.
        4. Please note that Plex does not know what content is located on a personal Plex Media Server.

        
    === "Unsubscribe from Emails"

        If you're receiving too many emails from Plex or you simply don't want to receive any promotional emails, it's recommended to adjust your email subscription settings to unsubscribe from all emails. By doing so, you'll stop receiving all non-essential emails from Plex, including promotional emails, account notifications, and updates. This will help declutter your inbox and prevent unnecessary distractions while still allowing you to enjoy using Plex. 
        
        You can change your email subscription settings here on the account settings page and selecting "Email Preferences." From there, you can uncheck all email types that you do not wish to receive and click "Save Changes" to update your settings.

Additionally, users can manage their privacy settings and choose which badges are displayed on their profile, whether to include their location, and if they want to add a short biography or a link to any other online presence. This allows for further customization of their profile and control over the information shared with other Plex users.

1. Hover over your profile picture and click on 'View Profile'.
2. Click on the 'Edit Profile' button.
3. You can update the final part of your profile to manage privacy settings and all personal information.
