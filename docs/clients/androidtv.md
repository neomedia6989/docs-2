    Plex has recently introduced a new feature called "Quality Suggestions" on select Android TV devices. This feature may automatically adjust the video quality based on your internet speed and other factors. If you notice this option in your settings, it is recommended to turn it off.

1. To adjust the video quality settings on your Nvidia Shield, Xiaomi MiBox or a similar device while using Plex, navigate to the "Settings" option located at the bottom of the left-hand navigation pane on the Plex home screen.
