# What is Plex?

Plex is a streaming service that allows you to watch movies, TV shows, and other media on your computer, smartphone, tablet, or smart TV. It's like having your own personal Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, but with content curated by someone you know and trust instead of a faceless corporation.

## How Do I Watch Content on Plex?
To get the best playback experience, you'll need to use a Plex player that's specific to your hardware and platform. Unless you have PlexPass, there is a small one-time fee (around $5 USD) to activate the Plex player on some platforms like iPhone and iPad, as well as Android phones and tablets. This fee unlocks the player on all devices associated with your account. Luckily, all other devices are free to use for all users.
