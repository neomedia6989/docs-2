# Getting Started with Blackbeard Shares

!!! danger "Closed to the Public"
    
    Our Plex shares are closed to the public and require a referral from an existing member to be able to sign up. Please do not attempt to sign up for our Plex share service without a referral, as your account will be rejected.

To sign up for our share service, you'll need a Plex account. If you don't have one already, you can get more info [here](/plex/getting-started).

Once you have a Plex account, you can sign up for our share service by going to [blackbeard.media/register](https://blackbeard.media/register) and entering the referral code provided by your friend or family member. After registering, you'll need to validate your email by clicking the link in the email that we send you.

Once you're validated, you can log in to [blackbeard.media](https://blackbeard.media) and access our home page, where you can learn more about our service and subscribe to any of our plans. We offer both pay-as-you-go and recurring subscriptions. If you have a promo code, make sure to select pay-as-you-go to use it. To sign up for your free trial or to subscribe, click the relevant link on the top of the navigation bar when you are signed in.

## My Account Page

Subscribers have access to various tools and information related to their subscription on our [My Account page](https://blackbeard.media/my-account). This includes managing their subscription, viewing payment history, and updating personal information. Keeping this information up-to-date is important to ensure that we can quickly assist with any issues that may arise while using our share service. In addition, you can also find your referral code on the same account page. Share this code with friends and family to receive credits for their subscription payments.

One key piece of information to update is your Discord username and ID. This allows you to join our Discord community and get support from our team and other users. You can easily update your Discord information by going to the [My Account page](https://blackbeard.media/my-account) and entering your full Discord username, including the discriminator, and your full Discord User ID.

If you're already in our Discord server, you can use the `!id` command in any channel to receive the necessary information in a DM from our bot; you can follow the gif below for an example.
