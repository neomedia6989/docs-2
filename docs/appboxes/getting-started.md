# Getting Started with Blackbeard Appboxes

## What is an Appbox?

An appbox is a private instance of Plex that you can use to store and stream your media content. Essentially, it's a virtual server that's set up just for you and whoever you choose to invite. With an appbox, you have complete control over your Plex instance, as you will be the administrator and can invite users as you wish.

Appboxes are a great way to have your own personal media server without having to worry about the maintenance and upkeep of physical hardware. You can access your media from anywhere with an internet connection and stream it to your devices with ease. Plus, with appboxes, you don't have to share your media with anyone else on the server, as each appbox is walled off from others on the same server.

When you order an appbox, you'll receive access to a web-based administration panel that allows you to manage your instance. You can add and remove users, manage media libraries, and perform other maintenance tasks. Plus, all appboxes come pre-loaded with content, so you can start streaming right away.

??? tip "Custom Autoscan"

    With Blackbeard Media's custom autoscan, your appbox will always stay up-to-date with the latest content changes, ensuring the best stability and performance. Unlike the default Plex behavior, our autoscan integrates with multiple programs to fetch changes in near real-time.
