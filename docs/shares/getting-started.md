# Getting Started with Blackbeard Media Shares

To sign up for our share service, you'll need a Plex account. If you don't have one already, you can get more info [here](../plex/getting-started.md).

Once you have a Plex account, you can sign up for our share service by going to **https://blackbeard.media/register** and entering the referral code provided by your friend or family member. After registering, you'll need to validate your email by clicking the link in the email that we send you.

Once you're validated, you can log in to **https://blackbeard.media** and access our home page, where you can learn more about our service and subscribe to any of our plans. We offer both pay as you go and recurring subscriptions. If you have a promo code, make sure to select pay as you go to use it.

We strongly recommend that you update your Discord information on your account page at **https://blackbeard.media/my-account**. This will allow you to join our Discord community and get support from our team and other users.

 To update their Discord information, users can go to https://blackbeard.media/my-account and enter their full Discord username, including the #1234 (or their discriminator), and their full Discord User ID. If they are already in our Discord server, they can simply type "!id" in any channel and our bot will DM them with the necessary information. Additionally, a helpful photo guide will be attached for reference. It's important to keep this information up to date so that we can quickly assist with any issues that may arise while using our share service.

You can also find your referral code on the account page, which you can share with your friends and family. For each person who signs up for a paid subscription using your referral code, you'll receive a credit that matches their first payment.

On your account page, you can manage your subscription, view your payment history, and update your personal information. If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team on Discord or through our contact page.
