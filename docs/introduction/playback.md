# Playback and Playback Quality in Plex

## Playback

Playback works very similar to how it does on other streaming services; on streaming devices, if you push the play button on a title, playback should begin immediately. If you press select/OK/enter, you'll be taken to the information page about a title. For movies this will include a summary and other information. For a TV show, this will go to a list of seasons. And from there you can select a season to view the list of individual episodes.

On a desktop client, when the mouse is over the title image, a Play button will be visible - if you click that, playback should begin. If you click elsewhere, the process will be similar to selecting on a streaming device.

## Playback Quality

Plex playback quality is dynamic and tries to adjust to the capabilities of your player and to the available internet bandwidth. However out of the box, the quality settings in most Plex players are very conservative of either 2Mbps or 4Mbps, which we highly recommend increasing.

To increase the quality of your playback experience, locate the settings in your Plex app, and navigate to the Video Settings section. Typically you should try to set Video Quality to Original or Maximum if possible. If you then find playback stutters or pauses frequently, reduce the quality setting until you achieve smooth playback. This will ensure that media is played on your device at the highest quality possible and can help reduce strain on the Plex server.

By default, Plex's out-of-the-box quality settings limit the bandwidth to 8Mbps, which means that many files will have to be transcoded to meet this limit. However, this can result in decreased video quality and increased server load. The good news is that adjusting the quality settings for your specific client can lead to optimum playback without unnecessary transcoding. To do this, simply select your client below and follow the recommended settings for the best possible playback experience:<br />
