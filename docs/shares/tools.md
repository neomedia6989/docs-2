# Tools

At our web portal, we offer a range of useful tools to all our subscribers to enhance their streaming experience. These tools are designed to help users troubleshoot common playback issues and add their own subtitles to movies or TV shows. With the Scan Missing Media feature, users can easily update Plex metadata and resolve playback errors caused by stale metadata. Our Upload Subtitles tool allows users to upload their own subtitle files and enjoy their favorite content in their preferred language. Both of these tools are accessible through our web portal and can be used with ease by all subscribers.

## Scan Missing Media Tool

The Scan Missing Media tool is a feature that helps to resolve playback issues that occur due to stale Plex metadata. These issues usually arise after a media upgrade, such as from 720p to 1080p. To use this feature:

1. Login to the Plex Web App on [app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv).
2. Navigate to the media *(movie or TV episode)* on the Plex server that has playback issues in the web browser.
3. Copy the URL from the browser and paste it into the URL field.
4. Click the Scan button.

This tool updates Plex metadata and usually resolves playback errors. It is available at [blackbeard.media/scan-media](https://blackbeard.media/scan-media).

## Upload Subtitles Tool

The Upload Subtitles tool is a feature that allows you to upload your own subtitles to your Plex media (movie or TV episode). To use this feature:

1. Login to the Plex Web App on [app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv).
2. Navigate to the Plex media (movie or episode) for which you want to add subtitles.
3. Copy the URL from the browser and paste it into the URL field.
4. Select the subtitle file. The file must be in SRT format and named in the following format: `Title (Year).ISO-639-1-Language-Code.srt` *(for example, `Black Widow (2021).en.srt`)*, as described in the Plex documentation.
5. Click the Upload button.
6. Refresh the page for the movie or TV episode, and the new subtitles should be available.

This tool is available at [blackbeard.media/subtitles-upload](https://blackbeard.media/subtitles-upload).


If the Scan Missing Media feature and Upload Subtitles tool do not resolve your playback issues, we encourage subscribers to create a support ticket on our Discord server. Our team is dedicated to ensuring that our share service is running smoothly, and we are always happy to assist with any issues that may arise. We strive to respond to all inquiries as quickly as possible to ensure that our users are enjoying their media with minimal interruptions.
