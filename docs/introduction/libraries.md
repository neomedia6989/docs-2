# Libraries

Plex servers are organized with Libraries in order to accomplish a number of things. Foremost this helps viewers locate the content they're looking for. Broad categories like TV Shows and Movies also enable the Plex server to obtain the correct information to fill in the details about content such as the synopsis, actors and other information about the media.

Libraries are often further separated into subjects like Reality TV, Kid's TV or Documentaries to facilitate finding what you want to watch.

***Note:** The Plex creators recently added new Libraries that appears for all users called Movies & TV On Plex, Web Shows, Podcasts and Music. Users should know that the ad-supported content in this special library is not provided by the owner of the Plex server and is available through a deal between Plex software and a number of movie and/or music studios. Plex server owners have no control over the content of this library. In most Plex players, you can find an option to Unpin this library from your list so it doesn't appear.*
