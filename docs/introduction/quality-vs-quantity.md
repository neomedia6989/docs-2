# Quality vs Quantity

The first and obvious indicator of how good a Plex server is often the raw amount of content offered. This is the easiest way to compare different offerings (200TB vs 50TB, 3000 Movies vs 750 Movies). The bigger the library, the higher the chance that you'll find what you're looking for. However, the amount of content is often not the full story. You can have 10,000 720p movies @1GB each take up a total of 10TB of space, as opposed to 200 4K movies @50GB each also taking up 10TB. As you can see, there is wide chasm between low quality and high quality. There are even differences between two files, both 1080p, which can range from 1GB to 30GB.

So you must find a library that is a decent size and offers a decent quality, and this is where reading the description and looking for keywords can help you demystify the type of library offered. Below, I have explained some of those words:

## Remux (~15-30 GB)
This keyword means that the content was taken directly from the retail DVD/BluRay and put into an easily streamable file format. This is usually the highest quality possible at the biggest file size (thus using the most data), requiring the fastest internet speeds. Along with the best video quality, they also have the best audio. Suitable for: Home Theater setups, Pixel Peepers, or those who simply want the best.

## P2P Encodes (~8-15 GB)
These are files that have been significantly reduced in size (from the above Remux) while maintaining a high enough quality through careful tweaking that most people would struggle to tell the difference from a Remux. Due to reduced file sizes, these often offer the best quality while using a reasonable amount of data. Suitable for: Those who want quality, but don't have the speeds or data necessary to play Remuxes.

## Scene Encodes (~5-10 GB)

Similar to P2P encodes, these files have been significantly reduced in size while maintaining a reasonable quality. These are automatically encoded, are available faster than the above encode, and are similar in quality to files offered by streaming services. Suitable for: Those with limited connections/speeds, who want to watch available movies ASAP. Great for watching on laptops/phones.

## Why Quality Matters
Low bit-rate content, in general, struggles to maintain transparency in a variety of scenarios such as low light scenes, high motion scenes or grainy scenes.

As someone who mostly watches drama shows (i.e., Game of Thrones, The Terror, Stranger Things), I'll notice quite a bit of noise, and blockiness, similar to the photo below.

I'll also notice over-smoothing in old grainy films, and in close-up shots of faces. I notice this quality loss on my home theater setup, my laptop, my TV, and, in serious cases, even on cell phone.

This loss of detail is one of the reasons I moved on from Netflix, and one the reasons I love Plex: more content, better quality, all in one place. So why this detour into quality?

If you are someone who watches reality shows, light dramas, comedies, animation, you will struggle to tell the difference between a Remux or a low bit-rate encode. Hell, even I do sometimes with two relatively good eyes and a penchant for only watching pixel-perfect content. If you also can't tell the difference in the aforementioned content or if you watch far away from your TV, or on a handheld device, OR if you simply don't care that much about the fine points of quality like I do, then these are all moot points for you.
