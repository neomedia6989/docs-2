# Libraries

Plex servers are organized with Libraries in order to help organize and sort content. Libraries are broad categories like TV shows and movies, and depending on what device or platform you're using Plex from, the interface can vary slightly. Typically, you will find a list of the Libraries on the server located in a table on the left side of the display. Clicking or tapping the name of a Library will change the content view on the bulk of the page to that Library.

Libraries are often further separated into subjects like 4K, Reality TV, Kid's TV or Documentaries to facilitate finding what you want to watch.[^1]

Plex recently created a Watchlist and Discover tab for users to curate and explore content as well. The Watchlist feature allows you to make a single list of all the movies or shows you plan to watch, regardless of where they’re found, even including content that’s not yet released. The Discover library, on the other hand, lets you browse trending and popular content from across your mediaverse, and shows you where it's available to watch, including any Plex Media Server available to your Plex account, Plex’s own free Movies & Shows streaming service, and other popular streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and Funimation, starting with the ones you regularly use.

With Plex and Blackbeard Media, you have control over what you watch and how you watch it. One of the main ways you can customize your viewing experience on Plex is by curating your own playlists and using filters and sorting options. You can easily access these features within each library, where you have the option to switch between Recommended, Library, Collections, or Playlists.

??? info "Recommended"

    This view shows a mix of items that are new or popular in the library selected by the server.
    
    We utilize this page to show you what is popular and trending with TMDb and Trakt charts as well as what is popular on streaming platforms, such as Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix and more!

??? info "Library"

    This view shows the full contents of the library in alphabetical order by default, but you can use filters and sorting to change how the list is presented. With personalized recommendations based on viewing history, you can find new content that fits your interests and preferences. Plex offers a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and find the content you want.

??? info "Collections"

    If the server owner has curated collections of content, they will appear here. These may include grouped genres of movies, different TV networks for series, or film franchises.
    
    We utilize Plex Meta Manager to keep up-to-date collections for all libraries to help organize content based on streaming service, broadcast network, popular and trending charts as well as country, franchise, language and more!

??? info "Playlists"

    If the server owner has curated playlists of content, such as all the films in a series, they may be presented here. It is normal if this page is empty.

One of the advantages of using Plex and Blackbeard Media is that it is available on a variety of devices and platforms, making it accessible to a wide audience. With our user-friendly navigation and extensive libraries of movies and TV shows, with audiobooks and music coming soon, you can easily find new content to explore based on your interests and preferences.

[^1]: The Plex creators recently added new Libraries that appears for all users called Movies & Shows, Live TV and Music. Users should know that the ad-supported content in these special libraries is not provided by the owner of the Plex server and is available through a deal between Plex software and a number of movie and/or music studios. Plex server owners have no control over the content of these libraries. In most Plex players, you can find an option to unpin these library from your list so it doesn't appear.
