# FAQ - Shares

## What is a Plex share?

A Plex Share is a fully-managed Plex server which you are invited to for streaming purposes via the Plex application on your device. You have no administrative permissions and no ability to add family/friends to the Plex instance. Your account is given a maximum amount of concurrent streams which you must adhere to at all times.

## How do I join the Plex share?

To join the Plex share, you need to be invited by an existing member as Plex shares are closed to the public. If you do have a referral, you can get more info on our [Getting Started with Blackbeard Shares](../shares/getting-started.md) page.

## How do I use the service after I subscribe?

To utilize your new subscription, you need to have a Plex account and a compatible device such as a computer, smartphone, tablet, or smart TV. Once you have been granted access by the server owner, you can log in to your Plex account and access the server's library of media content.

## How many devices can I use?
There is no limit on the number of devices you can use, but there is a limit on concurrent streams based on the your plan.

## Can I download content?
