## Improving Video Streaming by Changing DNS

When you want to watch a video on the internet, you have to tell your computer where to find it. It's like telling your friend where to find a toy in your messy room.

DNS (Domain Name System) is like a map that helps your computer find the video you want to watch. It tells your computer the address where the video is located on the internet, just like your mom might tell your friend the location of the toy in your room.

Sometimes, the map your computer is using might not be the best one, and it might take a long time for your computer to find the video. It's like trying to find a toy in your room using a really old and messy map.

By changing your DNS to a better one, it's like getting a new and improved map that helps your computer find the video faster. It's like having a new and organized map of your room that makes it easier for your friend to find the toy. So, changing your DNS can make it faster and easier for your computer to find and play the video you want to watch!

Here's how you can change your DNS settings on various devices:

### On a PC (Windows)

## Using a VPN for Video Streaming: Benefits and Considerations

Watching videos on the internet is like getting a pizza delivered to your house. Sometimes, the pizza delivery person has to take a really long and slow route to get to your house, and it can take a long time for your pizza to arrive.

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is like having a special delivery person who knows all the best shortcuts and can get your pizza to you faster. They can avoid traffic and take a faster route to your house, which means you get your pizza quicker!

But, a VPN can also help keep your information safe and secure while you're watching videos. It's like having a secret password that only you and the pizza delivery person know, so no one else can steal your pizza or your information.

However, our video service already has a special delivery person that knows all the best routes and shortcuts to get your videos to you quickly. It's like having a magic pizza delivery person who always knows the fastest way to your house. This way, you can watch your videos quickly without needing to use a VPN.

So, while a VPN can make your videos even faster and keep your information secure, most people don't need to use one because our service already has a magic delivery person to make sure your videos get to you quickly and easily.
