# Playback Quality

Plex playback quality is dynamic and tries to adjust to the capabilities of your player and to the available internet bandwidth. However out of the box, the quality settings in most Plex players are very conservative.

To increase the quality of your playback experience, locate the settings in your Plex app, and navigate to the Video Settings section. Typically you should try to set Video Quality to Original or Maximum if possible. If you then find playback stutters or pauses frequently, reduce the quality setting until you achieve smooth playback. This will ensure that media is played on your device at the highest quality possible and can help reduce strain on the Plex server.

You can find a more detailed breakdown of recommended settings for playback quality over in [client settings](../clients/index.md)
