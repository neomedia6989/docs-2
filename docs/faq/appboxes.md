# FAQ - Appboxes

## What is an appbox?

An appbox is a privately hosted Plex Media Server (PMS) instance on one of Blackbeard Media's servers. When you purchase an appbox, you are granted administrative access to your box. This allows you to invite your friends and family to use your PMS instance within the pre-defined connection and transcoding limits, as well as giving you the ability to edit your libraries, collections, and metadata to your preferences.

The appboxes that Blackbeard Media is selling are private Plex Media Server (PMS) instances hosted on Blackbeard Media servers. There are two types of appboxes:

- **Shared Appbox:** A type of appbox hosting arrangement where your appbox is placed on a shared server with other users' Appboxes. Each appbox is kept separate from the others, providing complete privacy so that you cannot see other appboxes on the shared server. To ensure a fair distribution of resources among all customers on any given server, shared appboxes are subject to enforced limits on the number of concurrent connections and/or transcoding.
- **Dedicated / Baremetal Appbox:** An appbox hosting arrangement where only one Plex Media Server instance is hosted on the server. This means that dedicated appboxes do not share resources with other appboxes, allowing for a much greater amount of connections and/or transcoding. As a result, users can enjoy a high-performance streaming experience without being limited by resource constraints.

Depending on the appbox you purchase, 4K content may not be included. It's important to check the specifications of each Appbox before purchasing to ensure that it meets your specific needs. When purchasing an Appbox, Blackbeard Media is responsible for the back-end operations of the service, such as maintaining the server and managing updates.
