# Plex Client - Tips

## Use a Wired Internet Connection

If possible, connect your device directly to your router using an ethernet cable instead of relying on Wi-Fi. This can provide a more stable and faster connection, which can help prevent buffering or stuttering during video playback.

## Close Unnecessary Apps

Before using Plex, make sure to close any other apps or programs that might be running in the background. This can help free up resources on your device and prevent any interference that could affect playback.

## Use a High-Quality Device

While Plex can work on a variety of devices, using a more powerful device with a faster processor and more RAM can provide a smoother and more seamless experience. See [here](https://docs.blackbeard.media/plex/playback/#what-device-should-i-buy-for-plex) for our recommendations on what device to purchase.

## Ensure Your Client is Up-to-Date

Make sure that the Plex app is updated to the latest version to ensure that it's running smoothly and without any bugs or issues.

## Use Direct Play

Whenever possible, use direct play instead of transcoding. Direct play allows the video to be played as is without any modification, which can help prevent playback issues and provide a better quality video.

## Optimize Your Network

Optimize your network by ensuring your router is in a central location, use the 5 GHz band instead of 2.4 GHz, ensure that your router firmware is up to date and is configured with optimal DNS settings.

## Use Infuse on Apple TV

For Apple TV users, consider using the Infuse app instead of the Plex app as it supports direct play of all video formats including Dolby Vision (DV) and lossless audio, which can provide a better quality video and audio experience.

## Disable Unnecessary Features

If you don't use the Discover feature, Live TV, or free Movies & Shows provided by Plex, it's recommended to turn them off to reduce clutter and optimize the user experience. This can prevent any unwanted content from showing up in your search results and simplify your media browsing experience. You can also [disable them from search results only](https://docs.blackbeard.media/plex/libraries/#disable-discover-feature-on-search), if you would like to keep them enabled.

## Unpin Unused Libraries

If you have multiple libraries in Plex but only use a few of them regularly, it's recommended to unpin the ones you don't use to reduce clutter and optimize the user experience. This can prevent any unwanted content from showing up in your library section and simplify your media browsing experience. Additionally, pinning only the libraries you browse through can reduce the time it takes to load your library section and improve performance.
