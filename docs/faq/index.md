## What products do you offer?

Blackbeard Media specializes in selling private Plex Media Server instances known as "appboxes." Additionally, we offer access to Plex shares, including a free share available exclusively to members of our Discord community. Please note that Plex shares are closed to the public and require a referral from an existing member to join.

## What is a Plex share?

A Plex Share is a fully-managed Plex server which you are invited to for streaming purposes via the Plex application on your device. You have no administrative permissions and no ability to add family/friends to the Plex instance. Your account is given a maximum amount of concurrent streams which you must adhere to at all times.

## How do I join the Plex share?

To join a Plex share, users need to be invited by an existing member as Plex shares are closed to the public. If you do have a referral, you can get more info on our [Getting Started with Blackbeard Shares](../shares/getting-started.md) page.
