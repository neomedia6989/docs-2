## How to setup your libraries

- Plex has their own libraries and content, while it's a nice bonus it is easy to confuse a Plex Library with a custom curated one that has been shared to you
- Find the hidden ellipses next to the item you wish to **Unpin**. *(We recommend removing all Plex's items, as seen in the screenshot)*

- Click on the **MORE** button to find the server that was shared with you

*Please note that the server name can be different depending on which server you were added*

- Locate a desired library of interest that is shared with you
- Click the ellipses and **Pin** the desired library *(Repeat this for all libraries of interest)*
