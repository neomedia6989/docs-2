# FAQ - Appboxes

## What is an appbox?

An appbox is a privately hosted Plex Media Server (PMS) instance on one of Blackbeard Media's servers. When you purchase an appbox, you are granted administrative access to your box. This allows you to invite your friends and family to use your PMS instance within the pre-defined connection and transcoding limits, as well as giving you the ability to edit your libraries, collections, and metadata to your preferences.

The appboxes that Blackbeard Media is selling are private Plex Media Server (PMS) instances hosted on Blackbeard Media servers. There are two types of appboxes:

`Shared Appbox` 
:    A type of appbox hosting arrangement where your appbox is placed on a shared server with other users' Appboxes. Each appbox is kept separate from the others, providing complete privacy so that you cannot see other appboxes on the shared server. To ensure a fair distribution of resources among all customers on any given server, shared appboxes are subject to enforced limits on the number of concurrent connections and/or transcoding.

`Dedicated / Baremetal Appbox` 
:    An appbox hosting arrangement where only one Plex Media Server instance is hosted on the server. This means that dedicated appboxes do not share resources with other appboxes, allowing for a much greater amount of connections and/or transcoding. As a result, users can enjoy a high-performance streaming experience without being limited by resource constraints.

Depending on the appbox you purchase, 4K content may not be included. It's important to check the specifications of each Appbox before purchasing to ensure that it meets your specific needs. When purchasing an appbox, Blackbeard Media is responsible for the back-end operations of the service, such as maintaining the server and managing updates.

## How can I get an appbox?

Users can get an appbox by visiting [blackbeard.shop](https://blackbeard.shop) and selecting the desired plan. Once the purchase is complete, users will receive an email with the login details for their dashboard, Kronos, where they can manage their appbox. See [Getting Started with Blackbeard Appboxes](../appboxes/getting-started.md) for more info.

## Do you offer a free trial?

Unfortunately, we do not offer a trial of our appbox services.

## What kind of content is available on an appbox?

Our appboxes come pre-loaded a wide variety of content, including thousands of movies, TV shows, and anime shows, with many available in 4K resolution.

## How many simultaneous streams can I have on an appbox?

The number of simultaneous streams that you can have on an appbox depends on the specific plan that you have chosen.

## How do I access my appbox?

To access your appbox for the first time, you will need to use the IP address provided on the Kronos dashboard. Once you have connected to the IP address and completed the initial setup, you will be able to access your appbox using any device with the Plex app installed. This can include devices such as smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and streaming media players. The Plex app can be downloaded for free from your device's app store. After installing the app, simply sign in with your Plex account credentials and your appbox content will be available to stream.

## Is the appbox fully configured after I claim it?

While your appbox will work right after claiming it, please create a [support ticket](https://discord.com/channels/532304048200744982/921503213432242196) on Discord to allow us to help guide you through the process.

## Can I use an appbox on multiple devices?

You can access your appbox on an unlimited number of devices and are only limited by the number of transcodes and total concurrent streams based upon your plan.

## Can I share my appbox with friends and family?

1. First, ensure that your Plex server is set up and running smoothly.

## What happens if I have technical issues with my appbox?

If you encounter any technical issues with your appbox, you can access the Kronos dashboard for assistance. The dashboard provides access to various tools that can help troubleshoot and resolve issues. These tools include restarting the server, resetting the Plex configuration to default settings, and rebuilding the Plex server if necessary.

If you are still having problems after using these tools, you can refer to our [troubleshooting section](#) for further guidance or create a [support ticket](https://discord.com/channels/532304048200744982/921503213432242196) on our Discord server.
