# What is Plex?

Plex is a streaming service that allows you to watch movies, TV shows, and other media on your computer, smartphone, tablet, or smart TV. It's like having your own personal Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, but with content curated by someone you know and trust.

## Is Plex free?
Plex is free to use as a software. However, on some mobile operating systems such as Android or iOS, a small one-time fee (around $5 USD) may be required to activate the Plex player on your iTunes or Google Play account. This will unlock the player on all the devices you use on your account.

Our streaming services that utilizes Plex do have costs. We offer Plex share plans ranging from $1.99 per month to $8.99 per month. Additionally, we offer appboxes which range from $14.99 to $29.99 per month. Appboxes allow users to invite their friends and family to join the server at no additional cost.
