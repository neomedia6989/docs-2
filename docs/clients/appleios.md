We have to change a few things here: First click on Remote Streaming, now you'll notice that there isn't an option for Original or Maximum like a lot of the other device. That's because it's hidden by default.

- Select the Show All menu option from the list.

- Select Maximum

- Automatically Adjust Quality: DISABLED
- Remote Streaming: Maximum
- Home Streaming: Maximum
