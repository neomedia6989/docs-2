# Navigation

Depending on what device or platform you're using Plex from, the interface can vary slightly, but typically you will find a list of the Libraries on the server located in a table on the left side of the display. Clicking or tapping the name of a Library will change the content view on the bulk of the page to that Library. Along the top of the main view you can switch between: Recommended, Library or Playlist.

## Recommended
This is a view of content the server selects that contains a mix of items in this library that are new or popular.

## Library
This view shows the full contents of the Library, in alphabetical order by default, but you can use filters and sorting to change how the list is presented.

## Collections
If the server owner has curated collections of content they will appear here, these may include grouped genres of movies, different TV networks for series, or film franchises.

## Playlists
If the server owner has curated playlists of content - such as all the films in a series - they may be presented here. It is normal if this page is empty.
